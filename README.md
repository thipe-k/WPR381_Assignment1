This repository provides a solution the a question paper that reads as follows.

Create a command line application that allows a user to input values that control a shape to be drawn, and the size of the shape. 
First the application must ask the user for the type of shape.  
The application should ask the user to specify a size (n) for the shape. 
Use the following shapes:
❖ Triangle [n refers to both the height and width];
❖ Square [ n refers to both the height and width]; 
❖ Diamond [n refers to both the width, and the height will be 2*n];
Please note:
❖ You can use any character to draw the shape.
❖ Your application must be arranged modularly.
❖ Your code should be testable. Code with syntax errors will result in a very low mark.
❖ You may find Node’s readLine module very useful.
❖ Use standard naming conventions when submitting.
❖ No late assignments will be accepted.
